## 📚 What I’m Learning

This project is helping me build:
- Real-world microservices with auth, file storage, real-time features (DM and videocalls), and rate limiting
- Secure JWT-based login flows
- Flutter UI best practices (responsive design + dark mode)
- CI/CD pipelines (coming soon, TBD)
This will be my **flagship project** for my resume.
